CODING RULES:

1) When starting a new curly brace, start on same line, and end curly should be at same level as the line which started it. EG:
	if(some_statement){
		code_goes_here();
	}
2) When using if-statements, even for single statements, always use curly braces. No letting any confusing sameline ifs.
	DO THIS:
		if(some_statement){
			single_line();
		}
	NOT THIS:
		if(some_statement) do_this();
	NOR THIS:
		if(some_statement)
			do_this();
3) camelCase or under_score is acceptable, but be consistent in a sourcefile.

REGARDING GenericList.h

When defining a list, use define_list(item), but only use it where the list you are defining the item to have a list made out of it. Thatway, to use a list of that type, you only have to import the item.h file.

When defining a type, it has to be one word. So if the type is a struct, enum, or other sort of multi-word types, you need to typedef them.

REGARDING COLORS

Since Ncurses allows us to use the colors on the terminal, colors need to be
paired and maped to integers. The Following is that mapping:
