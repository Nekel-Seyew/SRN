CODING RULES:

1) When starting a new curly brace, start on same line, and end curly should be at same level as the line which started it. EG:
	if(some_statement){
		code_goes_here();
	}
2) When using if-statements, even for single statements, always use curly braces. No letting any confusing sameline ifs.
	DO THIS:
		if(some_statement){
			single_line();
		}
	NOT THIS:
		if(some_statement) do_this();
	NOR THIS:
		if(some_statement)
			do_this();
3) camelCase or under_score is acceptable, but be consistent in a sourcefile.

REGARDING GenericList.h

When defining a list, use define_list(item), but only use it where the list you are defining the item to have a list made out of it. Thatway, to use a list of that type, you only have to import the item.h file.

When defining a type, it has to be one word. So if the type is a struct, enum, or other sort of multi-word types, you need to typedef them.
